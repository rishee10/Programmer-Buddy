                options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
                answer: 2,
                solution: "We can use the concept of cyclicity of powers of 2. The pattern of remainders when powers of 2 are divided by 5 is: 2^1=2 (remainder 2), 2^2=4 (remainder 4), 2^3=8 (remainder 3), 2^4=16 (remainder 1), and then it repeats. Since 31 mod 4 is 3 (because 4×7=28 and 31-28=3), the remainder will be the same as 2^3, which is 3."
            },

                options: ["26", "28", "30", "32"],
                answer: 2,
                solution: "Let the three consecutive even numbers be x, x+2, and x+4. Then, x + (x+2) + (x+4) = 84 ⇒ 3x + 6 = 84 ⇒ 3x = 78 ⇒ x = 26. So the numbers are 26, 28, and 30. The largest is 30."

                options: ["0", "2", "5", "6"],
                answer: 0,
                solution: "Unit digit of 6374^1793 depends only on 4. Pattern of 4's powers: 4,6,4,6,... So for odd power (1793), unit digit is 4. 625^317 always ends with 5. 341^491 ends with 1. Now multiply unit digits: 4 × 5 × 1 = 20 → unit digit 0."

                answer: 0,
                solution: "Let numbers be x and y. 60% of x = 3/5 of y ⇒ 0.6x = 0.6y ⇒ x/y = 1/1. Ratio is 1:1."

                options: ["60", "75", "80", "90"],
                answer: 1,
                solution: "Let number be x. x - (2/5)x = 45 ⇒ (3/5)x = 45 ⇒ x = 45 × 5/3 = 75."

                answer: 3,
                solution: "367 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Others: 119=7×17, 187=11×17, 247=13×19."

                answer: 0,
                solution: "Let number be 10x + y. x + y = 10. (10x + y) - 18 = 10y + x ⇒ 9x - 9y = 18 ⇒ x - y = 2. Solving: x + y = 10 and x - y = 2 ⇒ x=6, y=4. Number is 64."

                options: ["20", "23", "27", "30"],
                answer: 1,
                solution: "Let numbers be x and y. xy = 120, x² + y² = 289. (x + y)² = x² + y² + 2xy = 289 + 240 = 529 ⇒ x + y = √529 = 23."

                answer: 0,
                solution: "Let original price = 100, new price = 140. To keep expenditure same, consumption should be reduced so that 140 × new consumption = 100 × original consumption. So new consumption = 100/140 = 5/7 of original. Reduction = 1 - 5/7 = 2/7 ≈ 28.57%."

                options: ["4% increase", "4% decrease", "No change", "2% decrease"],
                answer: 1,
                solution: "Let the number be 100. After 20% increase: 120. After 20% decrease: 120 - (20% of 120) = 120 - 24 = 96. Net change = 100 - 96 = 4% decrease."

                options: ["20%", "25%", "33.33%", "40%"],
                answer: 0,
                solution: "Let B's salary = 100, then A's salary = 125. Difference = 25. Percentage difference relative to A's salary = (25/125) × 100 = 20%."

              answer: 0,
              solution: "The number of different 3-digit numbers is given by 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 (since repetition is allowed)."

              answer: 0,
              solution: "The number of ways to select 3 students from a group of 8 is given by C(8, 3) = 8! / (3! × (8 - 3)!) = 56."

              answer: 0,
              solution: "The area of a triangle is given by the formula: (Base × Height) / 2. So, the area = (10 × 6) / 2 = 30 cm²."

              answer: 1,
              solution: "The area of a circle is given by the formula: π × r². So, the area = 3.14 × 7² = 3.14 × 49 = 153.86 ≈ 49 cm²."

              answer: 1,
              solution: "The perimeter of a square is given by the formula: 4 × side length. So, the perimeter = 4 × 8 = 32 cm."

              answer: 0,
              solution: "The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by the formula: (n - 2) × 180° where n is the number of sides. So, (n - 2) × 180° = 1260. Solving for n, we get n = 12."

              answer: 0,
              solution: "Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know that the square of the diagonal equals the sum of the squares of the sides. So, 10² = 6² + x², where x is the other side. Solving for x, we get x = 8 cm."
